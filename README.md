## 💡 Why EduLite?

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, I (the founder) was still young and found existing learning platforms like Microsoft Teams difficult and slow. In 2023, a war broke out in Gaza, disconnecting us from schools for over a year. When e-learning resumed, my brothers and I were frustrated by how heavy and corporate-focused those tools were.

That’s when I asked:
> “Why aren’t we building something made for *students*?”

So I decided to build one — with you.
